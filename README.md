# MarsTime library

Christopher Lee, Ashima Research, 2011-


This package implements the Mars24 algorithm in javascript based on the Allison and McEwan(2000) paper. Details can be found at http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/ .

The Javascript library is contained entirely in the marstime.js file. A simple application is given in marstimeapp.js to calculate Mars rover times, and test code is tests.js and tests.html to run some basic tests on the library to compare with known data.
	
The library is available under the Modified BSD license. Please retain the references to the algorithm papers by Allison and McEwan(2000) and Allison(1997). Publications using the algorithm should reference those papers where appropriate.
